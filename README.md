## Description
```md
I added comments describing the functionality of the code found in [reducers.js]

What is the purpose of the action argument that gets passed to the reducer function?

How can we account for multiple types of actions inside the reducer?

Why do we create variable names for each action type in `actions.js`?

How do we make sure that the database is seeded?

Which `npm` package allows us to run both the front end and the back end at the same time? How do you start it?
